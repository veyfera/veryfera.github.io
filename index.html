It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing.[7] C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems." target="_blank">C</a>eñor desarrollador!</div>

'I am called Strider,' he answered: 'and though he may have forgotten it, your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me. 'You said I might hear something to my advantage, I believe,' said Frodo. 'What have you to say?' 'Several things,' answered Strider.</p>

            <h4>Education</h4>
            <p>The last grade/class exams were really tough, had to study university level material and lectures, became familiar with algorithms, data structures, OOP, theory of highload systems, OSI model and other advanced CS theory. At the same time I got an invitation for internship and covid started, making it extremely hard to apply to a university, ended up accepting the invitation. Now here I am with 4 year of commercial experience and a ton of side projects instead :)</p>

                <p>'What have you to say?' 'Several things,' answered Strider. 'But, of course, I have my price.' 'What do you mean?' asked Frodo sharply. 'Don't be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you what I know, and give you some good advice - but I shall want a reward.' 'And what will that be, pray?' said Frodo. He suspected now that he had fallen in with a rascal, and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought only a little money with him. All of it would hardly satisfy a rogue, and he could not spare any of it. 'No more than you can afford,' answered Strider with a slow smile, as if he guessed Frodo's thoughts. 'Just this: you must take me along with you, until I wish to leave you.'</p>
